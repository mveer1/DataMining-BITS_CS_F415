# DataMining-BITS_CS_F415

Assignment Problem Statement 1:
For this assignment, you will explore a data-set to find a useful pattern.
1. Apply K-Means clustering with K=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 for all 56 datasets and find the optimal value of clusters using Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index.
2. Apply Fuzzy C-Means clustering with c=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 for all 56 datasets and find the optimal value of clusters using Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index.
3. Store your results with single excel file with multiple rows i.e., one row for each project and Column used to represent Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index.
For Each Data-set: Column 1 to column 20 containing features and last column contain class information.


Assignment Problem Statement 2:
PART A:
1. Write programs to calculate info-gain, gain-ratio, gini-split, miss-classification error, and chi-square value for all features (all 56 datasets).
2. Rank the features using above metrics.

PART B:
1. Write programs to developed models using different version of decision tree.
2. Apply 10-fold cross validation
3. Store your results in terms of accuracy and F-measure with single excel file with multiple rows
For Each Data-set: Column 1 to column 20 containing features and last column contain class information.
